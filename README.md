# meetups
Create meetups that will allow you to congregate with people who share a commonality in order to forge friendships that last far beyond the hackathon.

## Potential Improvements
- Create an icebox version of database so that a meetup requires approval from an admin
- Do not allow a person to add themselves twice
  - This creates a problem with people with the same name
- UI/UX Tuneup
  - Add more cues for information especially in description field
- Persistent login
- Slack hooks for event reminders
- Better time inputs
